# hello-world
My first project to understand how to use GitHub

Ok so by just writting a new line of text I have created a new version of this "project document". 
It is really fullfilling to see the progress I learn things about Git & Github!
I look forward to make another commit/add/change & come back to the first version & modify that!
that's all folks!
